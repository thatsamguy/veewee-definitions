# Mageia 2 x86_64 server netboot template
- Uses Mageia ruby package
- Puppet and chef are install via rubygems
- Uses boot-nonfree.iso to allow for a greater variety of hardware

## TODO ##
- Fix ostype to something other than "RedHat_64" (Mageia_64 and Mandriva_64 are not supported by veewee or all VirtualBox)
